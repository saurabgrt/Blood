<pre><h2> 'Blood Bank India' is the first product resulted out of the community welfare initiative called 'People Project'.
 'Blood' is recognized as the most precious element that sustains life.It saves innumerable lives across the world
 in a variety of conditions. Once in every 2- seconds someone, somewhere is desperately in need of blood. More than
 29 million units of blood components are transfused every year. The need for blood is great - on any given day, 
 approximately 39,000 units of Red Blood Cells are needed. Each year, we could meet only up to 1% (approx) of our
 nation demand for blood transfusion.<br />
 Despite the increase in the number of donors, blood remains in short supply during emergencies, mainly attributed 
 to the lack of information and accessibility. We positively believe this tool can overcome most of these challenges
 by effectively connecting the blood donors with the blood recipients.<br />
 In this project it helps to find the easiest way of finding the nearest blood bank from your location so that we can
 save the live of the needy person.If the blood is empty on the blood bank then it have the list of donor in which 
 hospital can provide the details of the matching blood so we can contact her/him so that he/she can donate the blood
 & can take the small gift for the hospital.
